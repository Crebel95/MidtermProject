			<h2>History</h2>
			The first well-known UFO sighting occurred in 1947, when businessman
			Kenneth Arnold claimed to see a group of nine high-speed objects near
			Mount Rainier in Washington while flying his small plane. <br>
			Arnold estimated the speed of the crescent-shaped objects as several
			thousand miles per hour and said they moved “like saucers skipping 
			on water.” <br> In the newspaper report that followed, it was mistakenly
			stated that the objects were saucer-shaped, hence the term flying
			saucer.<br> <br> Sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena
			increased, and in 1948 the U.S. Air Force began an investigation of
			these reports called Project Sign. The initial opinion of
			those involved with the project was that the UFOs were most likely
			sophisticated Soviet aircraft, although some researchers suggested
			that they might be spacecraft from other worlds, the
			so-called extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH). <br> Within a year, Project
			Sign was succeeded by Project Grudge, which in 1952 was itself
			replaced by the longest-lived of the official inquiries into
			UFOs, Project Blue Book, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force
			Base in Dayton, Ohio. <br> From 1952 to 1969 Project Blue Book compiled
			reports of more than 12,000 sightings or events, each of which was
			ultimately classified as (1) “identified” with a known astronomical,
			atmospheric, or artificial (human-caused) phenomenon or (2)
			“unidentified.” <br> The latter category, approximately 6 percent of the
			total, included cases for which there was insufficient information to
			make an identification with a known phenomenon. <br>
